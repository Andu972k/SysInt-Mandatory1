# SysInt-Mandatory1
System consisting of 1 client and 2 servers.
The client and server 2 are written in python.
Server 1 is written in c#.
The point of the system is to integrate the client and servers, and send data between the components in different formats.
Client sends xml or json to server 1, server 1 sends json to server 2.
Server 2 replies with csv and so does server 1.
